## Background
In 2010, I started a project called `dropsonde`, a basic data mining and NLP 
toolkit for mining twitter. Armed only with a few months of Python experience,
a copy of [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596516499.do),
and my newly-acquired VPS, I decided to learn how to make sense of Twitter
programmatically. In the long term, I learned a lot of things but the project
was fragile and needed too much tending to.

One of the things that came out of this project was a basic NLP toolkit, which
is what this is.
